## Project Overview

BioScout Islamabad is an AI-powered web platform designed to enable community-driven biodiversity monitoring and conservation across Islamabad and nearby ecological areas such as Margalla Hills National Park.

This platform allows usersâ€”including schools, hikers, and conservationistsâ€”to submit observations of local flora and fauna, get AI-assisted species identification, and ask natural language questions about biodiversity via an intelligent Q&A system powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

The goal is to foster environmental awareness, empower citizen science, and support data-driven conservation aligned with global sustainability goals.

## Key Features

### Community Biodiversity Observation Hub

- User-friendly submission form for biodiversity observations, including:
  - Species name (scientific and common)
  - Date and location of observation (with map integration)
  - Image upload or URL
  - Notes for behavior/habitat details
  - Observer name

- Interactive map displaying submitted observations with markers and popups.

- Observation list with toggle to view top 50 or all entries.

- Basic gamification showing top observers and submission counts.

### AI-Powered Species Identification

- Mocked AI suggestions for species based on uploaded images.

- Clear labeling of AI-suggested identifications.

### RAG-Enhanced Biodiversity Q&A System

- Users can ask questions in plain English about local biodiversity.

- Backend performs semantic search over curated knowledge base and observation notes.

- Answers generated by combining retrieved context and a pre-trained language model.

### Analytics Panel

- Total observation count.

- Top 5 observers by submissions.

- Most observed species.

- Popular observation locations.

### About Us Page

- Information about BioScout Islamabad, its mission, and background.

- **AI Integration:**  
  - Species ID (mocked for prototype)  
  - RAG: Sentence Transformers for embeddings, FAISS for similarity search  
  - Hugging Face T5 model for answer generation (or fallback simulated)  
- **Image Storage:** Uploaded images saved on backend server under `/uploads`

## Backend API Endpoints

| Endpoint            | Method | Description                                     |
|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/observations`  | GET    | Returns all submitted observations              |
| `/api/submit`        | POST   | Accepts new observation submission (multipart) |
| `/api/ai-species-id` | POST   | Returns AI species ID suggestions (mocked)     |
| `/api/qa`            | POST   | Handles natural language biodiversity queries   |
| `/api/gamification`  | GET    | Returns top observer info                        |
| `/api/analytics`     | GET    | Returns analytics data (top observers, species, locations, total count) |

---

## Data Sources & Dataset

- Observations stored in `observations.csv` with fields:

  ```
  observation_id, species_name, common_name, date_observed,
  location, image_url, notes, observer
  ```

- Knowledge base (`knowledge_base.txt`) includes curated text snippets about Islamabadâ€™s biodiversity, ecosystems, and conservation efforts sourced from:

  - iNaturalist Islamabad page  
  - WWF Pakistan  
  - IWMB reports  
  - Local biodiversity blogs  

---

## How the RAG System Works

- User question is converted to embeddings with Sentence Transformers.
- Similarity search using FAISS retrieves top related knowledge base snippets + observation notes.
- Retrieved texts augment the prompt for a pre-trained language model (T5 or similar).
- The model generates contextually relevant answers about Islamabadâ€™s biodiversity.
- If no relevant info found, a polite fallback response is provided.

---

## Future Enhancements

- User accounts and authentication for personalized profiles.  
- Community validation for AI species identification suggestions.  
- Advanced semantic search using custom fine-tuned embeddings.  
- Multilingual support, especially Urdu.  
- Offline capability or PWA support for field data collection.  
- Integration with national biodiversity databases and NGO partnerships.  
- Visualization dashboards with charts & heatmaps.
