jsx
{/* Existing routes */}
<StatsPage />
Update styles.css:
Add the CSS I provided to your existing styles.css file
Copy the component code:
Copy each component's code to its corresponding .jsx file
Make sure imports match your actual file paths
Special Considerations for JSX Project
Check import paths: Ensure all imports reference the correct paths for your specific project structure.
JSX syntax: The code I provided uses standard JSX syntax, but double-check for any project-specific syntax requirements.
Navigation update: Since your project may have a different navigation setup, integrate the stats page link in your existing navigation pattern.
This adjusted structure should fit better with your existing React project layout using JSX files and a flatter organization.

# User Statistics and Rewards System Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to implement the user statistics and rewards system for BioScout Islamabad, including both backend and frontend components.

## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Backend Implementation](#backend-implementation)
3. [Frontend Implementation](#frontend-implementation)
4. [Mobile Optimization](#mobile-optimization)
5. [Integration](#integration)
6. [Testing](#testing)

## Overview

The user statistics and rewards system adds gamification elements to BioScout Islamabad, showing users their contribution metrics, earned rewards, and community rankings. The system is designed to be:

- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Engaging**: Uses visual elements to encourage participation
- **Informative**: Provides detailed statistics on user contributions
- **Community-oriented**: Shows how users compare to others

## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoints

Two new API endpoints need to be added to the Flask backend:

1. **User Statistics Endpoint**: `/api/user/stats/<username>`
   - Returns detailed statistics for a specific user
   - Includes observation counts, species diversity, rewards, and rank

2. **Community Leaderboard Endpoint**: `/api/community/leaderboard`
   - Returns leaderboards with top contributors in various categories
   - Provides community-wide statistics

### Implementation Steps

1. Add the provided code to your `backend/app.py` file.

2. Create the helper functions for reward calculation:
   - `calculate_user_rewards`: Determines which rewards a user has earned
   - `calculate_consecutive_days`: Finds the longest streak of consecutive observations
   - `calculate_monthly_trends`: Calculates monthly observation counts for trends

3. Test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl:
   ```bash
   # Test user stats endpoint
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/user/stats/username

   # Test community leaderboard endpoint
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/community/leaderboard
   ```

### Reward System Design

The reward system uses a three-tier structure (bronze, silver, gold) with rewards in different categories:

- **Observation Count**: Rewards for total number of observations
- **Species Diversity**: Rewards for documenting unique species
- **Location Explorer**: Rewards for visiting different locations
- **Ranking**: Rewards for community leaderboard position
- **Consistency**: Rewards for observation streaks

## Frontend Implementation

### Components Structure

1. **StatsPage.js**: Main page component with tab navigation
2. **UserStatsHeader.js**: User info with rank indicator
3. **RewardsGallery.js**: Display of earned and locked rewards
4. **StatsGraph.js**: Visualization of monthly contributions
5. **RankingsTable.js**: Community leaderboard with categories
6. **ContributionMap.js**: Map showing user's contribution locations

### Implementation Steps

1. Add the provided CSS to your styles directory (as `stats-page.css` or integrated into your main CSS file).

2. Create the component files in your project structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── pages/
   │   └── StatsPage.js
   └── components/
       └── stats/
           ├── UserStatsHeader.js
           ├── RewardsGallery.js
           ├── StatsGraph.js
           ├── RankingsTable.js
           └── ContributionMap.js
   ```

3. Update your App.js to include the new route:
   ```jsx
   <Route 
     path="/stats" 
     element={
       <ProtectedRoute>
         <StatsPage />
       </ProtectedRoute>
     } 
   />
   ```

4. Update the Navigation component to include a link to the stats page.

## Mobile Optimization

The statistics page is designed to be fully responsive with optimizations for mobile devices:

### Mobile-Specific Features

1. **Stacked Layout**: Components reflow to vertical alignment on smaller screens
2. **Touch-Friendly Tabs**: Tab buttons expand to full width for easier touch targets
3. **Simplified Tables**: Some table columns are hidden on very small screens
4. **Condensed Maps**: Map view height is reduced for mobile
5. **Mobile Navigation**: Uses the same navigation pattern as the main app

### Mobile Testing

Test the mobile experience on multiple devices and screen sizes:

1. Use browser developer tools to simulate various screen sizes
2. Test on actual mobile devices when possible
3. Check touch interactions on all clickable elements
4. Verify that all data is accessible on mobile

## Integration

### Integrating with Existing App

1. Import the CSS file in your main index.js or App.js:
   ```jsx
   import './styles/stats-page.css';
   ```

2. Update your app's navigation to include the new stats page:
   ```jsx
   <li>
     <Link to="/stats">My Stats</Link>
   </li>
   ```

3. Add the new routes to your Router configuration:
   ```jsx
   <Routes>
     {/* Existing routes */}
     <Route path="/stats" element={<StatsPage />} />
   </Routes>
   ```

### Data Considerations

The stats page makes API calls to fetch both user statistics and community leaderboard data. To optimize performance:

1. Implement state caching for frequently accessed data
2. Add loading states for async operations
3. Consider implementing backend pagination for large datasets

## Testing

### Backend Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Test reward calculation logic
2. **API Tests**: Verify correct response format for all endpoints
3. **Edge Cases**: Test with empty datasets and users with no observations

### Frontend Testing

1. **Component Tests**: Verify each component renders correctly
2. **Integration Tests**: Check data flow between components
3. **UX Testing**: Ensure all interactive elements work as expected
4. **Responsive Testing**: Verify layout on different screen sizes

### User Testing Scenarios

1. New user with no observations
2. Active user with many observations
3. User with a variety of species and locations
4. User with a long consecutive streak
5. Top-ranked user in the community
